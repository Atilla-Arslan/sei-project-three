    description: 'The sign outside announces "ale, cider, meat", and that pretty much sums up what\'s on offer at the best pub in Gospel Oak. The interior might make you think it\'s still 1936, as would the cash-only policy. The addition of cheese and charcuterie boards to the offering of meaty bar snacks is about as modern as it gets here. The roster of lovingly tended ales and ciders, all from small independent producers, changes regularly. There\'s also mulled cider. One of the many great things about the Southampton is that it retains its mixed clientele, long-time residents and newcomers alike – and of all ages. There/s also a pub dog. This is a true local hero.',

The interior reflects both the Gallic connection and its long standing in this most exciting of London neighbourhoods. It\'s small, memento-filled, and very crowded when the place is busy. You may end up joining the regulars on the pavement outside, but that\'s just part of the French House experience. Food is served during the daytime only, and beer, famously, is served only in halves. This is Soho history. Come and suck it up.',

In reality, Orwell was often found drinking at The Compton Arms in Islington. And 70-odd years on from that essay, his favoured pub now merits an essay of its own. In keeping with the considerate refurb, traditional ales remain on cask – Sambrook\'s Wandle and Adnams Ghost Ship side by side. The rest is all modern: London craft beers from the likes of Five Points and Partizan; a small but thoughtful wine list (a £6.50 glass of Argentinian malbec was full of juicy red fruit and vanilla flavours); a bold range of whiskies and mezcals; and a short cocktail list with three twists on the negroni.

In addition, there’s a 60-strong list of bottled beers, ciders and porters – mostly (but not all) from London brewers, all with clear, succinct tasting notes. These range from familiar names such as Brewdog or Camden Town Hells to properly niche offerings such as By The Horn\'s Sour to the People, a burgundy-aged, sour-mash vintage beer, or 750ml bottles of Siren\'s blended Ratchet artisan ale.',

The drinks selection is frankly ludicrous. There are more than 60 beers on offer (22 of them on tap), ranging from a pint of Camden Lager for less than a fiver (a near-miracle in Stoke Newington) to an 11 percent monstrosity called Marshall Zhukov\'s Imperial Stout that costs, I kid you not, £33 for 75cl. You can also choose from eight different gin and tonics and a perfectly serviceable wine list. Oh, and they do negronis on tap, which are flat-out gorgeous.

Regulars can be real characters, but it\'s refreshing to visit somewhere with a distinct lack of hipsters.

But the most important season of all is the footie kind – blinds had come down for better TV viewing when we visited. If football is this pub/s first love, beer would have to be its second. A long blackboard advertises 20 house, craft and cask beers. Local breweries Redemption, Pressure Drop and Beavertown are represented, but you/ll also spy Walthamstow and Bermondsey beers, plus Guinness and Heineken – theres a refreshing absence of craft beer snobbery that seems to have struck a chord with locals already.

But although the rooms inside date from the eighteenth century, it has only been a pub since 1990. Maybe it\'s because of this that it acknowledges the odd modern trend – poshed-up bar snacks, taxidermy cabinets – and the beer is anything but outdated, with premium-strength IPAs and whisky-accented ale (all of it from St Peter’s Brewery in Suffolk). If you like what you taste, you can pick up a five-litre mini-keg of the pub\'s most popular brews to take home. Seating is extremely limited and you\'ll need luck on your side to bag the coveted spot by the open fire, but the side-street setting means you won’t be herded into a roped-off pen when the crowd inevitable breaches the precincts and spreads on to the pavement.',

    description: 'For once, there\'s something poetic about this buyout. Since May, Hackney\'s Five Points Brewing Co has been the proud parent of The Pembury Tavern, a pub on the busy junction with Dalston Lane that the brewery took its name from. Rather than coming in all guns blazing, Five Points got a feel for things behind the bar before a refurb at the end of the summer. And with the team\'s sympathetic approach to the wants of existing punters, the two best things about the Pembury – pizza and pints – are still the main focus. The beer line-up has swung towards craft, but is committed to cask, too – it continues to stock Milton Brewery, the pub\'s previous owner. Expect the Five Points range on tap – its Railway Porter doing a storming trade – as well as options from UK indies. Beer festivals are niche, with a green hop event in swing when we visited. Pizzas are stonebaked NY-style, the toppings – like sesame seeds for added crunch – are occasionally original and a vegan range is very Hackney.',

    description: 'The first-world conundrum of whether to dedicate Saturday night to fine dining or serious drinking is tackled head-on by the folks behind the relaunched Marksman. This is the latest addition to Hackney Road\'s swelling crop of new and refurbed bars and restaurants. The owners decided have made few changes to the interior of this much-loved boozer, which means that the bar has retained many of the locals who used to prop it up. What has changed is the food, courtesy of head chefs and joint owners Tom Harris and Jon Rotheram, whose CVs include stints at St John, One Leicester Street and Fifteen. The Marksman isn\'t cheap, but it\'s good value for the calibre of cooking. Although there are plans to move the dining room upstairs come autumn, it\'s great to get such confidently prepared food in such a convivial, low-maintenance environment. Dinner here is like having your low-end/high-end cake and eating it too.',

On a warm day the Lady\'s many side doors are left wide open, and when it\'s woolly jumper weather there\'s a real fire to curl up next to. This commitment to comfort is typical of the pub\'s approach. Staff are subtly eager to please, talking you through any toss-ups between the house gin of the day or that craft lager you\ve not tried before. The Med-leaning gastropubby menu is exotic enough to make you feel they know what they’re doing but not so exotic that your gran would be forced to ask for just chips.',

    description: 'Sure, Hampstead has its fair share of loveable old hostelries, but The Duke of Hamilton – a 300-year-old pub – has an unusual recent history, too. Back in 2015, its landlord barred some 800 members of community group Hampstead Neighbourhood Forum after their successful campaign to make the pub an Asset of Community Value against his wishes. Those locals are now being welcomed back with open arms, with the pub under new ownership. It seems the new managers – local brothers Ed and Ben Robson, who also run The Clifton in St John\'s Wood, and their friend Adam Gostyn – are looking to the pub’s distant history, rather than its recent strife. They play up the historic pub name, with a story about a duelling duke used in fresh decorative elements. But while a renovation also hams up the best of its old features – including an original bar – a dusky green-grey colour scheme gives the room a cold feel, especially when teamed with old wooden furniture, and not a cosy sofa in sight. The new look seems to have dining first in mind, drinking second.',

But The Cross Keys is precisely that – with its canopy of copper implements, garish carpet and walls covered in vintage beeraphernalia, it feels like it hasn\t changed for 30 years. It\s a look which, these days, is uncommon enough to be endearing and, when paired with a line-up of mass-produced lager and real ale, evokes memories of a bygone era of boozing. Best of all, though, despite the local competition, the Cross Keys makes zero effort to appeal to tourists. Sort of ironic really, as standing outside in the failing sunlight, sipping a pint, taking deep lungfuls of the aroma wafting down from the nearby chippie, is one of the most perfectly English experiences you\ll get in the West End.',

The beer selection is unlikely to be exotic, keeping to familiar British ales from Fuller’s, Truman and some smaller breweries. A little shabby around the edges perhaps - A pub with carpet?

The Dove makes much of its history: a handbill details the comings and goings of Charles II and Nell Gwynn, while an 1897 photograph is one of the many visual nods to its prime location. But it’s too cosy and genuine to leave to the tourists. As Mr Fuller was one of the gentlemen involved in a 1796 takeover of the enterprise, it’s no surprise to find the full range of Fuller\s ales at the bar; they\re always in excellent condition. Inside, it\s basically a classic duck-your-head heritage pub experience, with a fire in the winter, but most drinkers come here to sit in the vine-entangled conservatory or the riverside terrace overlooking the houseboats.',
