    description: 'The sign outside announces ‘ale, cider, meat’, and that pretty much sums up what’s on offer at the best pub in Gospel Oak. The interior might make you think it’s still 1936, as would the cash-only policy. The addition of cheese and charcuterie boards to the offering of meaty bar snacks is about as modern as it gets here. The roster of lovingly tended ales and ciders, all from small independent producers, changes regularly. There’s also mulled cider. One of the many great things about the Southampton is that it retains its mixed clientele, long-time residents and newcomers alike – and of all ages. There’s also a pub dog. This is a true local hero.',

    description: 'If you like to drink in places where the history’s as important as the drinks list, the Grade II-listed French House should be on your list. Charles de Gaulle used the pub as a workplace during World War II; Dylan Thomas and Francis Bacon both drank here… the list goes on. The interior reflects both the Gallic connection and its long standing in this most exciting of London neighbourhoods. It’s small, memento-filled, and very crowded when the place is busy. You may end up joining the regulars on the pavement outside, but that’s just part of the French House experience. Food is served during the daytime only, and beer, famously, is served only in halves. This is Soho history. Come and suck it up.',

You can immediately see why the neighbourhood fought so hard to preserve the Chesham – the pub recently won its status as an Asset of Community Value after a fight that lasted years – and stepping inside just confirms things.' ,

    description: 'Of all the Thamesside pubs, this one is the most special, the most atmospheric, the most tucked-away – and its wooden deck at the back has probably the best view of the river too. If there’s a better accompaniment to an evening pint than the sound of the river slapping away through the slats under your feet, and the lights of the City twinkling away in the distance, we’ve yet to find it. Inside is brilliant too – it dates back to 1620, with ecclesiastical wooden pews, real ales, an open fire and a friendly hubbub of chatter. A real find of a pub.',

    description: 'If this pub were a film, it would be a heartwarming tale of pluck directed by Mike Leigh. In 2012, the owners gave their tenants one week’s notice to ship out after selling the property to developers. Instead of going quietly, the tenants set about raising £1 million with the help of the local community to buy the pub and turn it into a cooperative. Nowadays friendly, committed staff welcome locals of all ages for a mates-rates pint of locally brewed ale, carefully sourced pub food (including generous Sunday roasts), and events ranging from live music to yoga classes, knitting circles and kids’ dance lessons. It’s all housed in a Grade-II listed building, with original beams, wall-to-wall wood panelling, leaded windows and an open fire.',

    description: 'George Orwell loved pubs so much he wrote an essay about them. ‘The Moon Under Water’ was his ode to a fictitious pub that represented the best in boozing culture – a joint down a side street with handsome Victorian features, barmaids who knew your name and plenty of room to bend an elbow. In reality, Orwell was often found drinking at The Compton Arms in Islington. And 70-odd years on from that essay, his favoured pub now merits an essay of its own. In keeping with the considerate refurb, traditional ales remain on cask – Sambrook’s Wandle and Adnams Ghost Ship side by side. The rest is all modern: London craft beers from the likes of Five Points and Partizan; a small but thoughtful wine list (a £6.50 glass of Argentinian malbec was full of juicy red fruit and vanilla flavours); a bold range of whiskies and mezcals; and a short cocktail list with three twists on the negroni. Prices are fair, particularly for this well-to-do area.',

    description: 'So great is Kentish Town’s love of the Pineapple that when the pub was threatened with redevelopment into flats in 2002, locals started a campaign to save it – and got the place listed by English Heritage in just eight days. This backstreet boozer dates back to the mid-nineteenth century, and you can feel the history in the weathered wood of the joyously unmodernised main bar. There’s also a conservatory at the back, and outdoor tables when the weather’s good. The Pineapple hosts a variety of special events, including semi-annual beer festivals, but it’s at its best on an ordinary weekend, when the locals crowd in for a pint and a gab-fest. And there’s cheap Thai food if you want to settle in for the long haul.',

    description: 'The added-value attractions at this skinny little Church Street boozer are numerous: sporadic themed music nights, big-screen football, large beer garden. But the Shillelagh is at its best when it keeps things simple, as an honest, uncomplicated Irish pub (as opposed to Irish-themed pub; the difference is crucial) that draws a devoted circle of boozed-up Stoke Newingtonians most nights of the week. It’s the kind of pub where the wine list runs to ‘red or white’, and where the staff are so matey and hospitable that they’ll offer to bring your Guinness over to your table rather than have you hang around at the bar and wait for it to reach perfection. No wonder everybody here always seems to be in such a good mood.',
